## **myevic**
This is myevic Custom Firmware from ClockSelect https://github.com/ClockSelect/myevic/blob/master/src

### Based on:
*Original VTC Mini 3.03 firmware*

### Main Features:
The look-and-feel of the myevic firmware is more-or-less identical to the original firmware, so you shouldn't be lost.  
Many new features and options are made available through the menu system; I strongly encourage you to fully read the present documentation.
